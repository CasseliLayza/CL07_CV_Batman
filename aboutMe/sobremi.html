                <p><span class="negritaCursiba">Hello! my pleasure I am Casseli..! Electronic engineer with major
                        in the Telecoms field. This is just a little bit of me, I self-taught by nature and I really
                        like the professional challenges I am comfortable about working in a fast-paced team
                        environment. Where operate under pressure and have to hit strict timelines to be successful.
                        Thats' makes me feel alive!
                        I have a passion for customer satisfaction and engineering development. Working with a team
                        that strives to solve the customersâ€™ issues on the first try or develop a tough and amazing
                        project of telco ever will be a great accomplishment!
                        There are some key words that I'd like to share of me such as The Creativity, Abstract
                        Thinking, Recognize Patterns, find the beginning in reverse mode like Reverse Engineering
                        that's my cup of tea! I mean I really like to make easy tough things, for instance, to be
                        able to take complex information and present it in a clear, concise manner and be able to
                        explain it further if required by a customer or project!
                        <br><br>
                        So, if you need some help with Tech please don't hesitate to contact me! and I'll be really
                        happy to support you!
